The spear that never misses its target üéØ

### **docs/user-guide.md**
```markdown
# User Guide - Wotanzeroday Gungnir

## üèπ Welcome to Gungnir

Gungnir is your advanced SOC platform designed for precision threat hunting and zero-day vulnerability discovery. This guide will help you master the spear that never misses.

## üéØ Interface Overview

### Main Dashboard
- **Tactical Overview**: Real-time threat landscape
- **Neural Scanner**: Advanced vulnerability assessment
- **Threat Correlation**: Multi-stage attack detection
- **Hunt Platform**: Custom threat hunting queries
- **Intel Feed**: Live threat intelligence
- **Ops Journal**: Operational activity log

## üîç Neural Scanner

### Quick Scan
1. Navigate to "Neural Scanner" tab
2. Enter target (IP, domain, or range)
3. Select scan profile:
   - **Stealth Reconnaissance**: Minimal footprint
   - **Aggressive Enumeration**: Comprehensive discovery
   - **Vulnerability Assessment**: CVE correlation
   - **Red Team Simulation**: Full attack chain
   - **Compliance Validation**: Regulatory alignment
4. Click "Execute Advanced Scan"

### Interpreting Results
- **Risk Score**: 0-10 scale (10 = critical)
- **Exploitability**: Ease of exploitation
- **Business Impact**: Potential damage assessment
- **Recommendations**: Actionable remediation steps

## üß† Threat Correlation Engine

### Understanding Alerts
- **Critical**: Immediate action required
- **High**: Investigate within 1 hour
- **Medium**: Review within 4 hours
- **Low**: Monitor and document

### Attack Timeline
The correlation engine reconstructs multi-stage attacks:
1. Initial reconnaissance
2. Lateral movement attempts
3. Privilege escalation
4. Data exfiltration

## üéØ Threat Hunting Platform

### Query Templates
Use pre-built hunting queries:
- PowerShell execution analysis
- Lateral movement detection
- Suspicious DNS queries

### Custom Queries
Write KQL/Splunk compatible queries:
```kql
// Example: Hunt for suspicious processes
ProcessEvents
| where ProcessName contains "powershell"
| where CommandLine contains "EncodedCommand"
| summarize count() by Computer
Best Practices

Start with broad queries, narrow down
Use time windows for focused hunting
Correlate across multiple data sources
Document findings in Ops Journal

üìä Tactical Intelligence Feed
IOC Management

Confidence Levels: 0-100% reliability
MITRE ATT&CK: Technique mapping
